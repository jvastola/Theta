## 🔄 Remaining Work (15%)

### 1. Transport Broadcast & Receive (Priority: Critical) ✅ COMPLETED
**Estimated Effort:** 2 days (Nov 1-3) → **Actual: 1 day (Oct 31)**

#### Tasks:
- [x] **QUIC Stream Integration**
  - ✅ Implemented `TransportSession::send_command_packets(packets: &[CommandPacket])`
  - ✅ Hooked into replication stream (Stream 1) with length-prefixed framing
  - ✅ Added frame kind discriminator (0x01 for commands, 0x02 for deltas)
  - ✅ Packet sequence tracking via metrics handle

- [x] **Receive Pipeline**
  - ✅ Implemented `TransportSession::receive_command_packet() -> Option<CommandPacket>`
  - ✅ Deserialize incoming packets from replication stream
  - ✅ Generalized replication frame decoding with `DecodedReplicationFrame` enum
  - ✅ Skips component delta frames while awaiting commands
  - ✅ Logs unknown frame types for debugging

- [x] **Engine Integration**
  - ✅ Added `Engine::attach_transport_session(session: TransportSession)`
  - ✅ Lazy Tokio runtime initialization for async sends
  - ✅ Automatic drain of `CommandTransportQueue` when session attached
  - ✅ `block_on` pattern for synchronous frame tick integration

- ✅ Framing errors handled gracefully (unknown types logged, not crashed)
- ⚠️ Multi-client concurrent editing test deferred to integration suite

---

## Implementation Notes

### Design Decisions:

1. **CommandPacket Serialization**
   - Current: JSON-based (serde_json)
   - Future: Swap to FlatBuffers in Phase 5 for zero-copy deserialization
   - Rationale: JSON simplicity aids debugging; FlatBuffers swap localized to CommandPacket impl

2. **Signature Verification Placement**
   - Decision: Verify on `integrate_remote()`, not on packet receive
   - Rationale: Keeps transport layer agnostic; allows pluggable verifiers
   - Tradeoff: Invalid signatures consume decoder CPU (acceptable for trusted LAN)

3. **Conflict Resolution Timing**
   - Decision: Resolve conflicts on append, not on apply
   - Rationale: Deterministic rejection visible to sender immediately
   - Tradeoff: Rejected commands must be communicated to user (future UX work)

4. **Command Entity vs. Global Singleton**
   - Decision: Use ECS entity to hold CommandOutbox/TransportQueue
   - Rationale: Enables per-session command isolation (future multi-session support)
   - Tradeoff: Slightly more boilerplate than global Arc<Mutex<>>

5. **Replication Stream Framing**
   - Decision: Single QUIC stream (Stream 1) carries both commands and component deltas
   - Format: `[kind_byte: u8][length: u32 LE][payload: [u8]]`
   - Kind codes: 0x01 = command packet, 0x02 = component delta, 0xFF = unknown
   - Rationale: Unified framing simplifies transport layer; allows mixed payloads
   - Future: May split to dedicated streams if ordering requirements conflict

6. **Engine Async/Sync Bridge**
   - Decision: Lazy Tokio runtime in Engine; `block_on` for transport sends
   - Rationale: Engine frame tick is synchronous; minimal async code in hot path
   - Tradeoff: Blocking async calls on frame boundary acceptable for low-frequency commands
   - Future: Move transport to dedicated thread pool if send latency impacts frame rate

### Known Issues:

1. **No Nonce-Based Replay Protection**
   - Current: Duplicate detection via CommandId only
   - Risk: Replay attacks possible if attacker captures signed packets
   - Mitigation: Add monotonic nonce sequence in Phase 5
   - Priority: Medium (low risk in trusted LAN; critical for public internet)

2. **No Command Rate Limiting**
   - Current: No throttling on command append rate
   - Risk: Malicious client could spam commands (DoS)
   - Mitigation: Add per-author rate limiter in Phase 5
   - Priority: Low (trusted peer assumption for MVP)

3. **No Command Size Validation**
   - Current: No max payload size enforcement
   - Risk: Malformed commands could allocate unbounded memory
   - Mitigation: Add 64KB payload limit in transport receive path
   - Priority: Medium (add in future iteration)

4. **Remote Command Apply Not Yet Implemented**
   - Current: `receive_command_packet` retrieves packets but no automatic apply
   - Risk: Commands accumulate without integration into world state
   - Mitigation: Add `Engine::process_remote_commands` in Nov 1-3
   - Priority: High (required for world state convergence)

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risks:
1. **Transport Integration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Well-defined interfaces; loopback tests validate correctness
   - Impact: Minor schedule slip (1-2 days max)

2. **Metrics Overhead**
   - Mitigation: Lazy evaluation; metrics only computed when telemetry active
   - Impact: Negligible performance impact (<1% frame time)

### Medium Risks:
3. **Signature Verification Performance**
   - Mitigation: Ed25519 verify is ~70μs; batch verification future optimization
   - Impact: May require batching if command rate >1000/sec (unlikely in MVP)

### High Risks (None):
- No high-risk items identified for Phase 4 completion
